This spreadsheet includes three tables. The first table outlines additional fields for the MuseIT schema. Please add or propose any necessary fields you may need. The second table presents the fields from the existing Dataverse citation schema. If a field you need is marked as 'hidden,' please change its status to 'optional.' Note: 'ArtFormType' is a controlled variable, and the options are listed in a third table. Please add any art form types that you need as well.							Comments	
								
							To keep things clear we could use the term Object to refer to transformations that are created in MuseIT; Original CA can refere to the original cultural asset that is being represented in different modalities by MuseIT. What do you think?
